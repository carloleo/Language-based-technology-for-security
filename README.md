# Language-based-technology-for-security
The aim of the course is to understand what a programming language can provide through its implementation to improve security when a program will run.
We addressed memory corruption problems to appreciate what a memory and type safe programming language is and we studied how static analysis may improve security when a program will run. 

Hands-on part is reported here. We implemented some language-based tool by extending simple teaching functional programming language.
